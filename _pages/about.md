I am currently a first-year PhD at Imperial College London, supervised by Prof [Lucia Specia](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.specia). My research mainly focuses on robust natural language processing that deals with noisy and informal inputs. Specifically, I am greatly interested in machine translation, and langugage modeling.

Before starting PhD, I finished his MSc in Artificial Intelligence (Disctinction) at Imperial, also under the supervision of Prof Lucia. I obtained my BEng degree in Nanjing University where I majored software engineering.
