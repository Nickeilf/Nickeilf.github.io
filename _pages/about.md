I am a Lead Research Engineer at Epic Games, focusing on AI for game development (i.e. Epic Developer Assistant). Previously, I finished my PhD at Imperial College London, supervised by Prof. [Lucia Specia](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.specia) and Dr. [Marek Rei](https://www.marekrei.com/). Before starting PhD, I finished my MSc degree in Computing (Artificial Intelligence) with disctinction at Imperial College London, under the supervision of Prof. Lucia Specia. I obtained my BEng degree in Software Engineering from Nanjing University.

### Research Interests
I am currently working on AI for gaming, which involves exciting topics such as code generation, synthetic data, agentic system, and gameplay AI. Previously, I worked on robust natural language processing (e.g. handling noisy texts, model biases, and adversarial attacks), text moderation, and multimodal machine translation.
