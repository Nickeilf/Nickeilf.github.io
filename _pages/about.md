I am currently a second-year PhD in the [LAMA Lab](https://lama.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at Imperial College London, supervised by Prof. [Lucia Specia](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/l.specia) and Dr. [Marek Rei](https://www.marekrei.com/). My research mainly focuses on robust natural language processing that deals with unusual data, such as noisy texts, out-of-domain data, and adversarial attacks. Specifically, I am greatly interested in machine translation, and multimodal machine learning.

Before starting PhD, I finished my MSc degree in Computing (Artificial Intelligence) with disctinction at Imperial College London, also under the supervision of Prof. Lucia Specia. I obtained my BEng degree in Software Engineering from Nanjing University.
