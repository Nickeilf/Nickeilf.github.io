## Abstract
This paper describes our submission to theWMT 2019 Chinese-English (zh-en) newstranslation shared task.Our systems arebased on RNN architectures with pre-trainedembeddings which utilize character and sub-character information. We compare modelswith these different granularity levels usingdifferent evaluating metics. We find that a finergranularity embeddings can help the model ac-cording to character level evaluation and thatthe pre-trained embeddings can also be bene-ficial for model performance marginally whenthe training data is limited.
